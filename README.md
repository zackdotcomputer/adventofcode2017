My Advent of Code 2017 self-challenge: Do it all in Swift 4 Playgrounds

Spoilers, of course, for the solutions for adventofcode.com 2017

All 25 days' solutions are complete, but some of the code has been commented out. As you might
expect, Swift Playgrounds crash a LOT, especially if you throw NP-Complete problems at them.
Feel free to download and play around with any of the playgrounds, but know that a lot of the
solutions are only acheivable in realistic time by running the code directly:

```
$ > swift Contents.swift # in the root of the .playground folder
```
